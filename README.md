# Snake3DS
a clone of classic Snake made to play around with devKitPro and 3DS homebrew! Logic derived from my [Simple Snake](https://github.com/bennettrosenthal/Simple-Snake "Simple Snake"). project.

## How to Play
**This game requires your 3DS to be running CFW!**
1. Download the "Snake3DS.3dsx" file in the Releases tab on this page
2. Transfer the .3dsx file to your system's "3ds" folder at the root of your SD Card
3. Run the Snake3DS program in the Homebrew Launcher!

## How to Compile
### Prerequisites:
* devKitPro (https://devkitpro.org/)

Run "make" inside the main folder to compile the code. Transfer the .3dsx file to your system's "3ds" folder and run through the Homebrew Launcher.
